    "symptoms": "Different types of dementia can affect people differently, and everyone will experience symptoms in their own way.\nHowever, there are some common early symptoms that may appear some time before a diagnosis of dementia. These include:\n- memory loss\n- difficulty concentrating\n- finding it hard to carry out familiar daily tasks, such as getting confused over the correct change when shopping\n- struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word\n- being confused about time and place\n- mood changes\nThese symptoms are often mild and may get worse only very gradually. It's often termed \"mild cognitive impairment\" (MCI) as the symptoms are not severe enough to be diagnosed as dementia.\nYou might not notice these symptoms if you have them, and family and friends may not notice or take them seriously for some time. In some people, these symptoms will remain the same and not worsen. But some people with MCI will go on to develop dementia.\nDementia is not a natural part of ageing. This is why it's important to talk to a GP sooner rather than later if you're worried about memory problems or other symptoms."

    "disease": "Nephrotic syndrome in children",
    "description": "Nephrotic syndrome is a condition that causes the kidneys to leak large amounts of protein into the urine. This can lead to a range of problems, including swelling of body tissues and a greater chance of catching infections.\nAlthough nephrotic syndrome can affect people of any age, it's usually first diagnosed in children aged between 1 and 6 years old.",
    "symptoms": "- swelling – the low level of protein in the blood reduces the flow of water from body tissues back into the blood vessels, leading to swelling(oedema). Swelling is usually first noticed around the eyes, then around the lower legs and the rest of the body.\n- infections – antibodies are a specialised group of proteins in the blood that help to fight infection. When these are lost, children are much more likely to get infections.\n- urine changes – occasionally, the high levels of protein being passed into the urine can cause it to become frothy. Some children with nephrotic syndrome may also pass less urine than usual during relapses.\n- blood clots – important proteins that help prevent the blood clotting can be passed out in the urine of children with nephrotic syndrome. This can increase their risk of potentially seriousblood clots. During a relapse, the blood also becomes more concentrated, which can lead to clotting."

This is known as holoprosencephaly.\nWhen this happens, it can affect facial features and cause defects such as:\n- cleft lip and palate\n- an abnormally small eye or eyes (microphthalmia)\n- absence of 1 or both eyes (anophthalmia)\nOther abnormalities of the face and head include:\n- smaller than normal head size (microcephaly)\n- ear malformations anddeafness\nPatau's syndrome can also cause other problems, such as:\n- an abdominal wall defect where the abdomen does not develop fully in the womb, resulting in the intestines being outside the body, covered only by a membrane – this is known as an exomphalos or omphalocoele\n- abnormal cysts in the kidneys\nThere may also be abnormalities of the hands and feet, such as extra fingers or toes (polydactyly) and a rounded bottom to the feet, known as rocker-bottom feet."

The lack of melanin in your skin can turn the hair in the affected area white or grey.\nVitiligo often starts as a pale patch of skin that gradually turns completely white. The centre of a patch may be white, with paler skin around it. If there are blood vessels under the skin, the patch may be slightly pink, rather than white.\nThe edges of the patch may be smooth or irregular. They're sometimes red and inflamed, or there's brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation).\nVitiligo does not cause discomfort to your skin, such as dryness, but the patches may occasionally be itchy.\nThe condition varies from person to person. Some people only get a few small, white patches, but others get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin.\nThere's no way of predicting how much skin will be affected. The white patches are usually permanent."
